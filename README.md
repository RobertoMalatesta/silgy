# Silgy

Simple and fast web application backend framework for C and C++ programmers.

The latency between receiving HTTP request and application logic has been reduced to single microseconds by linking web engine and application into a single executable that becomes a very fast, single-threaded asynchronous web server with custom logic.

## Why bother?

Back in 2015 I decided to write a web application and had a wishlist:

1. It has to be **responsive**, in a way compiled programs used locally are responsive. It needs to feel solid and reliable. My application consistently gets "Faster than 100% of tested sites" [badge from Pingdom](https://minishare.com/show?p=MWPcAbmY).

2. Host it for **free** or at negligible cost. Websites that don't survive at least 10 years (or have a huge marketing budget) don't matter â€“ it's not 1995 anymore. I wanted to make sure I'll be able to afford hosting for the rest of my life, or until users count would reach at least a million. I actually pay $3 per month for my ~500 users application and use ~1% of the server's resources.

3. **Independency**. AWS getting nasty? It'd take 60 minutes to move anywhere else, most of them spent on setting up an account at my new cloud provider. Then I only need to install GCC, MySQL, restore database from backup, clone my repo and type `silgystart`, Enter.

As my wishes had come true, I decided to open my code and become famous. You're welcome.

## What's in the box?

As I am writing this in May 2019, Silgy lib contains everything that is necessary to build a complete, production-grade solution, including [session management](https://github.com/silgy/silgy/wiki/Sessions-in-Silgy) and [REST calls](https://github.com/silgy/silgy/wiki/RESTful-calls-from-Silgy).

The only third-party dependencies are:

* USERS module requires MySQL library.

* HTTPS requires OpenSSL library.

Silgy Hello World handles [~20,000 requests per second](https://github.com/silgy/silgy/wiki/Performance-test:-select()-vs-poll()) on a single CPU, free AWS instance.

Silgy has build-in (and enabled by default) protection against most popular attacks, including BEAST, SQL-injection, XSS, and password and cookie brute-force. It does not directly expose the filesystem nor allows any scripting. Its random string generator is FIPS-compliant.

TCO for a mid-sized web application with a small database and moderate load (<1,000,000 requests/day) can be as low as $3 per month (Amazon [EC2 t2.micro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/)).

In case of using Silgy under heavy load or with external API calls, there's the [ASYNC facility](https://github.com/silgy/silgy/wiki/Silgy-ASYNC) designed to prevent main (silgy_app) process blocking. ASYNC allows developer to split (or move) the functionality between gateway and multiple service processes.

## Hello Worlds

### Empty application = static web server

This is just an extremely fast static web server. If no resource is requested it'll look for `index.html` in [res](https://github.com/silgy/silgy#res) directory. If requested file is not present in `res` nor `resmin`, it'll return 404.

```source.c++
void silgy_app_main(int ci)
{
    RES_STATUS(404);
}
```

### Simplest Hello World

Return static file if present, otherwise "Hello World!".

```source.c++
void silgy_app_main(int ci)
{
    OUT("Hello World!");
}
```

### Simple HTML with 2 pages

Application, yet without moving parts.

```source.c++
void silgy_app_main(int ci)
{
    if ( REQ("") )  // landing page
    {
        OUT_HTML_HEADER;
        OUT("<h1>%s</h1>", APP_WEBSITE);
        OUT("<h2>Welcome to my web app!</h2>");
        OUT_HTML_FOOTER;
    }
    else if ( REQ("about") )
    {
        OUT_HTML_HEADER;
        OUT("<h1>%s</h1>", APP_WEBSITE);
        OUT("<h2>About</h2>");
        OUT("<p>Hello World Sample Silgy Web Application</p>");
        OUT("<p><a href=\"/\">Back to landing page</a></p>");
        OUT_HTML_FOOTER;
    }
    else  // page not found
    {
        RES_STATUS(404);
    }
}
```

### Using query string value

Finally some logic. [QS()](https://github.com/silgy/silgy/wiki/QS) will automatically choose between query string or payload, depending on the HTTP request method.

```source.c++
void silgy_app_main(int ci)
{
    if ( REQ("") )  // landing page
    {
        OUT_HTML_HEADER;

        OUT("<h1>%s</h1>", APP_WEBSITE);
        OUT("<h2>Welcome to my web app!</h2>");

        if ( REQ_DSK )
            OUT("<p>You're on desktop.</p>");
        else  /* REQ_MOB */
            OUT("<p>You're on the phone.</p>");

        OUT("<p>Click <a href=\"welcome\">here</a> to try my welcoming bot.</p>");

        OUT_HTML_FOOTER;
    }
    else if ( REQ("welcome") )  // welcoming bot
    {
        OUT_HTML_HEADER;
        OUT("<h1>%s</h1>", APP_WEBSITE);

        OUT("<p>Please enter your name:</p>");
        OUT("<form action=\"welcome\"><input name=\"firstname\" autofocus> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Run\"></form>");

        QSVAL qs_firstname;   // query string value

        if ( QS("firstname", qs_firstname) )    // if present, bid welcome
            OUT("<p>Welcome %s, my dear friend!</p>", qs_firstname);

        OUT("<p><a href=\"/\">Back to landing page</a></p>");

        OUT_HTML_FOOTER;
    }
    else  // page not found
    {
        RES_STATUS(404);
    }
}
```

## Directories

Although not necessary, it's good to have $SILGYDIR set in the environment, pointing to the project directory. Silgy engine always first looks in `$SILGYDIR/<dir>` for the particular file, with `<dir>` being one of the below:

### `src`

*(Required only for development)*

* Application sources. It has to contain at least `silgy_app.h` and `silgy_app.cpp` with `silgy_app_main()` inside.
* Compilation script: `m`

### `lib`

*(Required only for development)*

* Silgy engine & library source
* `users.sql`

### `bin`

* Executables, i.e. `silgy_app`, `silgy_svc`, `silgy_watcher`
* Runtime scripts, i.e. `silgystart`, `silgystop`
* Configuration: `silgy.conf`

### `res`

Static resources. The whole tree under `res` is publicly available. All the files are read on startup and served straight from the memory. File list is updated once a minute.

* images
* static HTML files
* text files
* fonts
* ...

### `resmin`

Static resources to be minified. The whole tree under `resmin` is publicly available. All the files are read on startup, minified and served straight from the memory. File list is updated once a minute.

* CSS
* JS

### `logs`

* Log files
